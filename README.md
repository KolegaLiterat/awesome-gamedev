# awesome-gamedev
I just made this list to arrange different gamedev resources. I just get tired of looking through different Google Spreadsheets, reddit topics and repositories. So I just decided to create my own awesome list based on differnt sources.

**Based on**
- My own research and data
- [Reddit topic about gamedev tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/tp4fuz/what_is_the_one_gamemaking_tool_you_use_that_you/)
- [69 Tools We Use To Make Our Game Satisfactory - Coffee Stain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6ao9-UIZIQ)
